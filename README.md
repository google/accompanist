Accompanist is a group of libraries which contains some utilities which I've found myself copying around projects which use [Jetpack Compose][compose]. Currently it contains:

 * üé® [Material Design Components theme integration](./mdc-theme/README.md)
 * üñºÔ∏è [Coil image loading composables](./coil/README.md)

[Jetpack Compose][compose] is a fast moving project and I'll be updating these libraries to match the
latest tagged release as quickly as possible. Each [release listing](https://github.com/chrisbanes/accompanist/releases) will outline what version of Compose and the UI libraries it depends on.

## Download

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation "dev.chrisbanes.accompanist:accompanist-mdc-theme:<version>"
    implementation "dev.chrisbanes.accompanist:accompanist-coil:<version>"
}
```

### Accompanist Snapshots

Snapshots of the current development version of Accompanist are available, which track the latest commit.

<details><summary><strong>Snapshot repository instructions</strong></summary>

The snapshots are deployed to Sonatype's `snapshots` [repository][snap]:

```groovy
repositories {
    // ...
    maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' }
}

dependencies {
    // Check the latest SNAPSHOT version from the link above
    classpath 'dev.chrisbanes.accompanist:accompanist-mdc-theme:vXXX-SNAPSHOT'
    classpath 'dev.chrisbanes.accompanist:accompanist-coil:vXXX-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

You might see a number of different versioned snapshots. If we use an example:

* `0.1.5-SNAPSHOT` is a build from the `main` branch, and depends on the latest tagged Jetpack Compose release (i.e. [dev12](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/ui#0.1.0-dev12)).
* `0.1.5.ui-6574163-SNAPSHOT` is a build from the `snapshot` branch. This depends on the [SNAPSHOT build](https://androidx.dev) of Jetpack Compose from build 6574163. You should only use these if you are using Jetpack Compose snapshot versions (see below).

### Using Jetpack Compose Snapshots

If you're using [`SNAPSHOT`](https://androidx.dev) versions of the `androidx.ui`
or `androidx.compose` libraries, you might run into issues with the Accompanist dependency forcing an older version of those libraries.

<details><summary><strong>Jetpack Compose snapshot instructions</strong></summary>

I do publish snapshot versions of Accompanist which depend on recent Jetpack Compose SNAPSHOT repositories. To find a recent build, look through the [snapshot repository][snap] for any versions in the scheme `x.x.x.ui-YYYY-SNAPSHOT` (for example: `0.1.5.ui-6574163-SNAPSHOT`). The `YYYY` in the scheme is the snapshot build being used from [AndroidX](https://androidx.dev) (from the example: build [`6574163`](https://androidx.dev/snapshots/builds/6574163/artifacts)). You can then use the steps above to setup the Accompanist snapshot repositories.

I update these builds regularly, but there's no guarantee that I will create one for a given build number.

#### Why the name?

The library is all about adding some utilities around Compose. Music composing is done by a
composer, and since this library is about supporting composition, the supporting role of an [accompanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accompaniment) felt like a good name.
