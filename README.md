Accompanist is a group of libraries which aim to supplement [Jetpack Compose][compose] with features which are commonly required by developers, but not yet available.

Currently Accompanist contains:

### üñºÔ∏è Image loading
A number of libraries which integrate popular image loading libraries into Jetpack Compose: [Coil](./coil/) and [Glide](./glide/).

### üìê [Insets](./insets/)
A library which brings [WindowInsets](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/view/WindowInsets) support to Jetpack Compose.

### üç´ [System UI Controller](./systemuicontroller/)
A library which provides easy-to-use utilities for updating the System UI (status and navigation bars) colors from Jetpack Compose.

### üé® [AppCompat Theme Adapter](./appcompat-theme/)
A library that enables reuse of [AppCompat][appcompat] XML themes for theming in [Jetpack Compose][compose].

### üìñ [Pager](./pager/)
A library which provides paging layouts for Jetpack Compose, similar to Android's [`ViewPager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/viewpager/widget/ViewPager).

### üì´ [Permissions](./permissions/)
A library which provides [Android runtime permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview) support for Jetpack Compose.

### ‚è≥ [Placeholder](./placeholder/)
A library which provides easy-to-use modifiers for displaying 'placeholder' UI while content is loading.

## Updates

[Jetpack Compose][compose] is a fast-moving project and we aim to keep these these libraries up-to-date with the
latest tagged release on Compose as quickly as possible. Each [release](https://github.com/google/accompanist/releases)  outlines what version of the Compose libraries it depends on.

## Future?

Any of the features available in this group of libraries may become obsolete in the future, at which point they will (probably) become deprecated. 

We will aim to provide a migration path (where possible), to whatever supersedes the functionality.

## Snapshots

Snapshots of the current development version of Accompanist are available, which track the latest commit. See [here](docs/using-snapshot-version.md) for more information.

### Why the name?

The library is all about adding some utilities around Compose. Music composing is done by a
composer, and since this library is about supporting composition, the supporting role of an [accompanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accompaniment) felt like a good name.
