Accompanist is a group of libraries which contains some utilities which I've found myself copying around projects which use [Jetpack Compose][compose]. Currently it contains:

 * üé® [Material Design Components theme integration](./mdc-theme/README.md)
 * üñºÔ∏è [Coil image loading composables](./coil/README.md)

[Jetpack Compose][compose] is a fast moving project and I'll be updating these libraries to match the
latest tagged release as quickly as possible. Each [release listing](https://github.com/chrisbanes/accompanist/releases) will outline what version of Compose and the UI libraries it depends on.

## Download

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation "dev.chrisbanes.accompanist:accompanist-mdc-theme:<version>"
    implementation "dev.chrisbanes.accompanist:accompanist-coil:<version>"
}
```


### Snapshots

Snapshots of the current development version are available, which track the latest commit.

<details><summary>Snapshot repository instructions</summary>

The snapshots are deployed to 
[Sonatype's `snapshots` repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/dev/chrisbanes/accompanist/):

```groovy
repositories {
    // ...
    maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' }
}

dependencies {
    // Check the latest SNAPSHOT version from the link above
    classpath 'dev.chrisbanes.accompanist:accompanist-mdc-theme:vXXX-SNAPSHOT'
    classpath 'dev.chrisbanes.accompanist:accompanist-coil:vXXX-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

</details>

### Using AndroidX Snapshots

If you're using [`SNAPSHOT`](https://androidx.dev) versions of the `androidx.ui`
or `androidx.compose` libraries, you might run into issues with the Accompanist dependency forcing an older version of those libraries. See below for how to force your chosen version.

<details><summary>Force version instructions</summary>

This is because versioned releases of Accompanist will only depend on tagged versions of libraries (i.e. `v0.1.0-dev12`). Since you're using a newer `v0.x.x-SNAPSHOT`, you need to tell Gradle to force those dependency versions:

``` groovy
val composeVersion = 'v0.1.0-SNAPSHOT'

configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy.eachDependency { details ->
        switch (details.requested.group) {
            case 'androidx.ui':
                details.useVersion composeVersion
                break
            case 'androidx.compose':
                details.useVersion composeVersion
                break
        }
    }
}
```

You can put that within a `subprojects { ... }` block in your root `build.gradle`.

#### Why the name?

The library is all about adding some utilities around Compose. Music composing is done by a
composer, and since this library is about supporting composition, the supporting role of an [accompanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accompaniment) felt like a good name.
