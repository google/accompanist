/**
 * In the scrollable containers we want to clip the main axis sides in order to not display the
 * content which is scrolled out. But once we apply clipToBounds() modifier on such containers it
 * causes unexpected behavior as we also clip the content on the cross axis sides. It is
 * unexpected as Compose components are not clipping by default. The most common case how it
 * could be reproduced is a horizontally scrolling list of Cards. Cards have the elevation by
 * default and such Cards will be drawn with clipped shadows on top and bottom. This was harder
 * to reproduce in the Views system as usually scrolling containers like RecyclerView didn't have
 * an opaque background which means the ripple was drawn on the surface on the first parent with
 * background. In Compose as we don't clip by default we draw shadows right in place.
 * We faced similar issue in Compose already with Androids Popups and Dialogs where we decided to
 * just predefine some constant with a maximum elevation size we are not going to clip. We are
 * going to reuse this technique here. This will improve how it works in most common cases. If the
 * user will need to have a larger unclipped area for some reason they can always add the needed
 * padding inside the scrollable area.
