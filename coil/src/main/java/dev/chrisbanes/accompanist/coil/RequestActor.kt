/**
 * RequestActor is a wrapper around a [Channel] to implement the actor pattern.
 *
 * You pass input parameters to the actor via [send], which will be processed. Then in a coroutine
 * you should start the actor by calling [run], passing in a lambda to be notified of any results.
 *
 * When creating a [RequestActor] you just need to pass in a [execute] lambda which is
 * executed on every distinct parameter passed in.
 *
 * As an example for use in Compose, you would typically do this:
 *
 * ```
 * var text by state { "" }
 *
 * val requestActor = remember {
 *     RequestActor<Int, String> { input ->
 *         generateStringForInt(input)
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * launchInComposition(requestActor) {
 *     requestActor.run { input, result ->
 *         text = result
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * // Send the actor something to act on
 * requestActor.send(439)
 *
 * // do something with text
 * ```
