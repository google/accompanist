![Accompanist logo](header.png)

Accompanist is a group of libraries that contains some utilities which I've found myself copying around projects which use [Jetpack Compose][compose]. Currently, it contains:

 - 🖼️ [Coil image loading composables](./coil)
 - 🖼️ [Picasso image loading composables](./picasso/README.md)

[Jetpack Compose][compose] is a fast-moving project and I'll be updating these libraries to match the
latest tagged release as quickly as possible. Each [release listing](https://github.com/chrisbanes/accompanist/releases) will outline what version of Compose libraries it depends on.

### Accompanist Snapshots

Snapshots of the current development version of Accompanist are available, which track the latest commit. See [here](docs/using-snapshot-version.md) for more information.

#### Why the name?

The library is all about adding some utilities around Compose. Music composing is done by a
composer, and since this library is about supporting composition, the supporting role of an [accompanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accompaniment) felt like a good name.
